Thanks for helping make GitHub safe for everyone.

# Security

GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/GitHub).

Even though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation. 

## Credential Security

This project stores Emporia Vue credentials via environment variables (for example, in `.env`) for convenience during development. **Important security notes:**

- **Never commit secrets to Git** – keep `.env` out of source control
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for your Emporia Vue account
- **Restrict environment file permissions** (e.g., `chmod 600 .env` on Unix systems)
- **Rotate or remove credentials** if the `.env` file is shared or compromised
- **For production deployments**, prefer managed secret stores over plain environment files

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to opensource-security[@]github.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
